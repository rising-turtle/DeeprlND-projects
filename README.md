This repo contains implementations to the projects of the Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree by Udacity. The projects
we have to implement as part of the course are the following:

- [x] **Simple navigation using DQN**: Implement a DQN-based agent to collect bananas in a virtual environment.
- [ ] **Continuous control with DDPG and PPO**: Implement a (DDPG|PPO)-based agent to control its arm to reach a target location.
- [ ] **Cooperation (Open ended project)**: Train two agents in a cooperative way to play tennis.

## [Project 1: DQN](https://github.com/wpumacay/DeeprlND-projects/tree/master/project1-navigation)
